We will move through the files in their numbered order. At the conclusion of the course I will share my scripts that I completed.

## World Bank Key Indicators Website

The World Bank Indicator Code consists of three parts:

1. Topic: A three-letter code that represents the broad topic or category to which the indicator belongs. For example, the code "NY" represents indicators related to national accounts and economic performance.

2. Indicator: A two-letter code that represents the general indicator within the given topic. For example, the code "GDP" represents the Gross Domestic Product indicator.

3. Indicator detail: Codes that specific specific details of the indicator.

4. Extension: An optional extension to the code that provides further details or specificity for certain indicators. For instance, an extension like ".MKTP.CD" might refer to Gross Domestic Product measured in current U.S. dollars.

Here's an example of a complete World Bank Indicator Code:

```
NY.GDP.MKTP.CD
```

- "NY" represents the topic (national accounts and economic performance).
- "GDP" represents the specific indicator (Gross Domestic Product).
- ".MKTP.CD" is the extension for this particular GDP indicator (measured in current U.S. dollars).

The World Bank provides a comprehensive catalog of its indicators along with their corresponding codes, and these can be accessed through their data platform or official website. However, please note that the coding system or practices might have evolved since my last update, so it's always best to refer to the most current information from the World Bank directly for the latest details on how they code their indicators.
